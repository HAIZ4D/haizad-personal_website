                        among teachers in every state, making it a national-level event. My friends and I, as the technical committee, 
                        played an important role in handling the technical aspects, such as field setup, umpiring, and managing the scoreboard. 
                        This program taught me how to work effectively with diverse groups of people to achieve common goals, as well as the
                         rules of softball.

                        Additionally, serving as the program’s photographer gave me hands-on experience in capturing high-quality action shots and event photography. Through this role, I improved my creativity, attention to detail, 
                        and ability to work under pressure to capture the best moments. Managing multimedia also strengthened my teamwork, communication, and time management
                        skills as I collaborated with others to ensure the tournament’s success. Overall, this program has been a valuable opportunity for me to grow both creatively and professionally.
